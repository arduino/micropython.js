# stepper.py

# A micropython driver for 4-phase, unipolar stepper motors such as
# the 28BYJ-48

# Relesed to the Public Domain by Nicko van Someren, 2020

# The constructor for the Stepper class takes as arguments the four
# pins for driving the motor phases, in phase order, and optionally a
# timer. The pins can be passed as pin numbers or machine.Pin objects
# and the timer can be a machine.Timer object or a timer index. Note
# that if two stepper motors use the same timer then they will not be
# able to run at the same time.
#
# The run() method takes a number of steps and an optional delay (in
# seconds) between driving the steps (the default is 1ms). A negative
# step count will drive the motor in the oposite direction to a
# positive count. The count represents "half steps" since the driver
# alternates driving single coils and driving pairs of adjacent coils.
# Calls to run() return immediately; the motor runs on a timer in the
# background. Calling run() again before the previous command has
# finished adds the new count to the old count, so the destination
# position is the sum of the requests; the delay is set to the new
# value if stepper is not already at its final location.
#
# The stop() method will stop the rotation of the motor. It returns
# the number of un-taken steps that would be needed to perform the
# outstanding requests from previous calls to run().
#
# The is_running property returns true if the motor is running,
# i.e. stop() would return a non-zero value, and false otherwise.
